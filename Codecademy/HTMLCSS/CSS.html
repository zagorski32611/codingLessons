<!-- You learned that RGB and hex color
codes are two different methods of
representing the same thing: color.
However, there is one feature that RGB
colors support that hex color codes do not: opacity.

Opacity is a measure of how transparent a color is.
To modify opacity in RGB colors, CSS offers the rgba() value.
Note the slight difference in rgb() and rgba().
the first three in the set are the normal red, blue, green. The last
decimal is a measure of opacity between 0 and 1, inclusive. -->
<style>
h1 {
  color: rgba(123, 88, 9, 0.5);
}




<!-- many older browsers do not support rgba, HSL or HSLa. So always put a
redundant color option -->
h1 {
  color: rgb(22, 34, 88);
  color: rgba(22, 34, 88, 0.4);
}

</style>
<!-- you can link to Google fonts to make sure that any browser supports
the fonts you choose for your page: -->
<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" >
</head>

<!-- Text on a web page must also be easy to read. When text is styled to
appear larger, the vertical spacing between lines of text can decrease,
creating text that is difficult to read, particularly in paragraphs.

To avoid this problem, you can modify the spacing between lines of
text with the line-height property. -->
<style>
p {
  line-height: 1.5em;
}
In CSS, the font-weight property turns bold on or off.

p {
  font-weight: bold;
} <!-- makes stuff bold! -->
h3 {
  font-style: italic;
} <!-- obviously makes stuff italic -->

h1 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
} <!-- makes everything upper case! -->
