<!-- btw, the br tag is self closing! <br />

<!-- this is for everything! ^^
You can use the <link> element to link the HTML and CSS files together.
 The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file.
 It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:

href - like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the
address, or path, to the CSS file.

type - this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking
to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set
to text/css.
rel - this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and
the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should
be set to stylesheet. -->
<link href="#filepath" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">


<!-- You can batch edit elements in CSS too and * selects ALL elements: -->
<style>
h1 {
 color: FireBrick;

}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

h1, p {
  color: DarkSlateGray;
}

* {
  font-family: Georgia;

}

</style>
