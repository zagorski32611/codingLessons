/*So we know that a class will have certain properties and methods,
but what keeps track of what a given class can or can't do? What a class
 has or doesn't have? That is the job of the prototype.

JavaScript automatically defines the prototype for class with a constructor.
 For example, our Dog constructor ensures that the
 Dog prototype has a breed property. Remember, the Dog prototype keeps
 track of what Dog has, doesn't have, can, or can't do.

We know we can add methods to objects, and in line 27 we add the bark
method to buddy. Hit run and you will see one "Woof" printed when buddy barks.
 Notice what happens when we try to get snoopy to bark in line 36 though.
  Even though snoopy is of the class Dog, he doesn't know how to bark because
  only buddy had bark added as a method.

*/

  this.breed = breed;

/* Classes are very important in object-oriented programming. This is because
a class tells us helpful information about objects, and you can think of an
object as a particular instance of a class.

For example, look at our Person class again in the console. We know that any
Person will have a name and age, because they are in the constructor.
This allows us to create a function like printPersonName, which will take a
Person as an argument and print out their name. We know the function will work
on any Person, because name is a valid property for that class. */

/* Here we have very similar code as last time, but there is an
important difference. Instead of using buddy.bark to add the bark
 method to just the buddy object, we use Dog.prototype.bark.

Click run this time, and both buddy and snoopy can bark just fine!
Snoopy can bark too even though we haven't added a bark method to that
 object. How is this so? Because we have now changed the prototype for
 the class Dog. This immediately teaches all Dogs the new method.

In general, if you want to add a method to a class such that all members
of the class can use it, we use the following syntax to extend the prototype: */

inheritance allows one class to see and use the methods and properties of

all the same properties and methods as Animal. Whenever this X is-a Y

property to be this value. Don't set a numLegs property in the constructor.
Similar to what we did in the previous exercise, make Emperor inherit from
Penguin by setting the prototype of Emperor to be Penguin.
Create a new emperor object that is an instance of the Emperor class with
any name you'd like. Then use console.log to print the number of legs emperor
hasâ€”this should have been inherited from Penguin!

/*
Up the Food-I-mean-Prototype Chain
A penguin is an animal and an emperor penguin is a penguin. Are emperor penguins animals too? Of course!
The "prototype chain" in JavaScript knows this as well. If JavaScript
encounters something it can't find in the current class's methods or properties,
it looks up the prototype chain to see if it's defined in a class that
it inherits from. This keeps going upwards until it stops all the way at
the top: the mighty Object.prototype (more on this later). By default,
all classes inherit directly from Object, unless we change the class's
prototype, like we've been doing for Penguin and Emperor.

Instructions
Let's see how going up the prototype chain works! We've defined some classes
and inheritance patterns: Emperor inherits from Penguin which inherits from
Animal. We've also created an instance of the Emperor class.
Without modifying anything other than lines 22-24, complete the console.log
statements to print the appropriate responses.
Remember how the prototype chain works: if a property is not defined for a
class, this class's prototype chain will be traversed upwards until one is
found (or not) in a parent (higher) class.

/*In JavaScript all properties of an object are automatically public.
Public means that they can be accessed outside the class. Think of these
properties as the information a class is willing to share.
Look at the Person class. It has 3 public properties: firstName,
lastName, and age. On lines 8 and 9, we access the firstName and
lastName properties of john and assign them to myFirst and myLast.
Notice that we are free to access the firstName and lastName properties,
which is what we mean when we say they are public. */

/* Good! But what if an object wants to keep some information hidden?

Just as functions can have local variables which can only be accessed from
within that function, objects can have private variables. Private variables
are pieces of information you do not want to publicly share, and they can only
be directly accessed from within the class.

The Person class has been modified to have a private variable called
bankBalance. Notice that it looks just like a normal variable, but it is
defined inside the constructor for Person without using this, but instead
using var. This makes bankBalance a private variable. */

function Person(first,last,age) {
   this.firstname = first;

   var bankBalance = 7500;
}

var john = new Person("John", "Smith", 30);

// try to print his bankBalance

/*Accessing Private Variables
Although we cannot directly access private variables from outside the class,
there is a way to get around this. We can define a public method that returns
the value of a private variable. */
function Person(first,last,age) {
   this.firstname = first;
   this.lastname = last;
   this.age = age;
   var bankBalance = 7500;

   this.getBalance = function() {
      // your code should return the bankBalance
      return bankBalance;
   };
}

var john = new Person('John','Smith',30);
console.log(john.bankBalance);

// create a new variable myBalance that calls getBalance()
var myBalance = john.getBalance();
console.log(myBalance);


/*Private Methods
Why did that code work? An object's private variables can only be accessed by
other methods that are part of that same object. So, we just used an object's
public method to access a private variable!
Methods can also be private within a class and inaccessible outside of
the class. Changing this.returnBalance from the last exercise to
var returnBalance makes this method private. If you run the program trying to
access the method you get an undefined error this time.
The way to access a private method is similar to accessing a private variable.
You must create a public method for the class that returns the private method.

Instructions
Create a method called askTeller within the Person class that returns
the returnBalance method. This means that it returns the method itself
and NOT the result of calling that method. So you should NOT have parentheses
after returnBalance. Because askTeller returns a method, we need to call it to
make it any use. This is what var myBalance = myBalanceMethod(); does. */
function Person(first,last,age) {
   this.firstname = first;
   this.lastname = last;
   this.age = age;
   var bankBalance = 7500;

      return bankBalance;

   // create the new function here DO NOT FORGET THE this.askTeller!!!

       return returnBalance;

}

var john = new Person('John','Smith',30);
console.log(john.returnBalance);
var myBalanceMethod = john.askTeller();
var myBalance = myBalanceMethod();
console.log(myBalance);


/*Passing Arguments
The askTeller function has been modified within the Person class to directly
give you your balance. However, it now needs the account password in order to
return the bankBalance.
Instructions
Create a new variable called myBalance that calls the askTeller function with
a password argument, 1234. */
function Person(first,last,age) {
   this.firstname = first;
   this.lastname = last;
   this.age = age;

     if (pass == 1234) return bankBalance;
     else return "Wrong password.";
   };

/* the variable myBalance should access askTeller()
   with a password as an argument  */

/*Looks For-In To Me
Objects aren't so foreign if you really think about it!
Remember you can figure out the type of a variable by using typeof myVariable;.
Types we are concerned with for now are "object", "string", and "number".
Recall the for-in loop:
for(var x in obj) {
executeSomething();
}
This will go through all the properties of obj one by one and assign
the property name to x on each run of the loop. Let's combine our knowledge
of these two concepts.
Instructions
Examine the languages object. Three properties are strings, whereas one is a number.
Use a for-in loop to print out the three ways to say hello. In the loop,
you should check to see if the property value is a string
