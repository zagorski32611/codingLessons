Broadway wants to build a Rails app for their home page. Here's what it looks like.

Looking at the request/response cycle, we need three parts to build this Rails app -
a route, a controller, and a view.

To preview your app at any point:

In the terminal, type rails s -p 4001
In the browser, visit http://localhost:4001
