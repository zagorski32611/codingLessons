User model
Using the request/response cycle as a guide, here's how authentication fits in:

Turn one:

When a user visits the signup page, the browser makes an HTTP GET request for the URL /signup.
The Rails router maps the URL /signup to the Users controller's new action. The new action handles the request and passes it on to the view.
The view displays the signup form.
Turn two:

When the user fills in and submits the form, the browser sends the data via an HTTP POST request to the app.
The router maps the request to the Users controller's create action.
The create action saves the data to the database and redirects to the albums page. The action also creates a new session.
What is a session? A session is a connection between the user's computer and the server running the Rails app. A session starts when a user logs in, and ends when the user logs out.
1.
Looking at the request/response cycle, we need five parts to add signup machinery to the app: a model, a controller, routes, views, and logic for sessions. Let's start here by creating a model.

Generate a model named User.
2.
In app/models/user.rb, add a method named has_secure_password.
=end
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_secure_password

end

#3. In the Gemfile on line 30, uncomment the bcrypt gem
# 4. Install the gems.
#______________________________________________________________________________
=begin
User migration
What did we just do?

We created a model named User.
In the model, we used the method has_secure_password. This method adds functionality to save passwords securely.
In order to save passwords securely, has_secure_password uses an algorithm called bcrypt. To use bcrypt, we added the bcrypt gem to the Gemfile.
Now that the User model is set up, let's continue by adding columns to the migration files.
Instructions
1.
Open the migration file in db/migrate/ for the users table and add:

a string column called first_name
a string column called last_name
a string column called email
a string column called password_digest
2.
Run a migration to update the database.
=end


=begin
Signup I
Nice work! You've added columns to the users table and ran a migration to update the database.

What's the password_digest column for? When a user submits her password, it's not a good idea to store that password as is in the database; if an attacker somehow gets into your database, he would be able to see all your users' passwords.

One way to defend against this is to store passwords as encrypted strings in the database. This is what the has_secure_password method helps with - it uses the bcrypt algorithm to securely hash a user's password, which then gets saved in the password_digest column.

Then when a user logs in again, has_secure_password will collect the password that was submitted, hash it with bcrypt, and check if it matches the hash in the database.
Instructions
1.
Now that the models are set up, let's move on to the rest of the request/response cycle and create the controllers, routes, and views needed for the signup machinery.

Generate a controller named Users.
2.
In the routes file, add these routes:

get 'signup'  => 'users#new'
resources :users
=end

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'albums#index'
  get 'albums' => 'albums#index'
  get 'albums/new' => 'albums#new'
  get 'albums/:id' => 'albums#show', as: :album
  post 'albums' => 'albums#create'
	get 'signup' => 'users#new'
  resources :users
end

=begin
Signup II
Great! When you visit the URL /signup, the browser makes a GET request for the URL. This request hits the Users controller's new action, which returns a view displaying the signup page.
Instructions
1.
Next, let's take in data submitted through the signup form and save it to the database.

In the Users controller, add a private method user_params

private
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email, :password)
  end
2.
Between the new action and the private method, add the create action

def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)
  if @user.save
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect_to '/'
  else
    redirect_to '/signup'
  end
end
=end
# the users controller will look like this:

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @user = User.new
  end
  def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)
  if @user.save
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect_to '/'
  else
    redirect_to '/signup'
  end
end
  private
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email, :password)
  end
end

=begin
AUTHENTICATION
Users
Nice job! Now when you fill in the signup form and submit it, the data is sent to the Rails app via a POST request. The request hits the User controller's create action. The create action saves the data, creates a new session, and redirects to the albums page.

How is a new session created? Sessions are stored as key/value pairs. In the create action, the line

session[:user_id] = @user.id
creates a new session by taking the value @user.id and assigning it to the key :user_id.
Instructions
1.
Let's check whether the data saved to the database using the Rails console. The Rails console is a useful tool to interact with Rails apps. We'll use it here to query the database.

Start the Rails console by running

rails console  (in the temrinal!)

2.
Retrieve all signed up users in the database by typing

User.all (in the terminal)
Your information should show up in the results.
3.
Visit http://localhost:8000/signup to sign up a few more users through the signup form.

Use the Rails console to retrieved all signed up users again.
4.
Exit the Rails console by typing exit.
=end


=begin
Login I
Now that users can sign up for a new account, let's add the ability to log in and log out of the app. Using the request/response cycle as a guide again, here's how logging in and logging out fits in.

Turn one:

When the user visit the login page, the browser makes a GET request for the URL /login.
The Rails router maps the URL /login to the Sessions controller's new action. The new action handles the request and passes it on to the view.
The view displays the login form.
Turn two:

When the user fills in and submits the form, the browser sends the data via a POST request to the app.
The router maps the request to the Sessions controller's create action.
The create action verifies that the user exists in the database. If the user exists, the create action logs the user in by creating a new session. Otherwise, it reloads the login page.
Instructions
1.
Let's begin by adding a login page. Looking at the request/response cycle, we need five parts to add login machinery to the app: a model, a controller, routes, views, and logic for sessions. As we already created the User model when building the signup page, let's start here by creating a controller.

Generate a controller named Sessions.
2.
In the routes file, create a route that maps requests for the URL '/login' to the Sessions controller's new action.
3.
In the Sessions controller, add the new action

def new
end
4.
Then in app/views/sessions/new.html.erb, on line 7, use form_for to create a login form:

<%= form_for(:session, url: login_path) do |f| %>
  <%= f.email_field :email, :placeholder => "Email" %>
  <%= f.password_field :password, :placeholder => "Password" %>
  <%= f.submit "Log in", class: "btn-submit" %>
<% end %>
We've also provided CSS in app/assets/css/application.css.
5.
Restart the Rails server and visit http://localhost:8000/login in the browser.

The form won't work just yet. We'll finish it up next.
=end



=begin
Login II
Well done!

When you visit the URL /login, the browser makes a GET request for the URL. This request hits the Sessions controller's new action, which returns a view displaying the login page.
In the login form, we use form_for(:session, url: login_path) do |f|. This refers to the name of the resource and corresponding URL. In the signup form, we used form_for(@user) do |f| since we had a User model. For the login form, we don't have a Session model, so we refer to the parameters above.
Instructions
1.
Next, let's take in data submitted through the form and log the user in by starting a new session.

In the routes file, create a route that maps the URL '/login' to the Sessions controller's create action.

post 'login' => 'sessions#create'
2.
In the Sessions controller, add the create action

def create
  @user = User.find_by_email(params[:session][:email])
  if @user && @user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect_to '/'
  else
    redirect_to 'login'
  end
end
3.
Visit http://localhost:8000/login and log in with your email and password.

LOGOUT!
Logout
Nice job! Now when you fill in the login form and submit it, the data is sent to the Rails app via a POST request. The request hits the Sessions controller's create action. The create action checks whether your email and password exist in the database, creates a new session, and redirects to the albums page.
Instructions
1.
Now that users can log in, let's add the ability to log out.

In the routes file, create a route that maps the URL /logout to the Sessions controller's destroy action:

delete 'logout' => 'sessions#destroy'
2.
In the Session controller, add the destroy action by setting the session hash to nil and redirecting to the root path

def destroy
  session[:user_id] = nil
  redirect_to '/'
end
=end
=begin
current_user
Great work so far! We've built an authentication system that lets new users sign up for the site, and lets existing users log in and out.

However, there's one problem - even after you log out, you can still access the albums page. Why does this happen? Let's look at the request/response cycle:

Currently when a user visits the URL /albums, the browser first makes a request for that URL.
The request hits the Rails router.
The router sends the request to the Albums controller's index action regardless of whether a user is logged in.
What we want instead is for only users who are logged in to see the albums page; otherwise they should be redirected to the login page. This means that we need to check whether a user is logged in before sending her request on to the Albums controller's index action. Let's see how to do this.
Instructions
1.
In app/controllers/application_controller.rb, add a method named current_user

helper_method :current_user

def current_user
  @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]
end
2.
Below current_user, add another method named require_user:

def require_user
  redirect_to '/login' unless current_user
end
=end
=begin
Filters
How do these methods work?

The current_user method determines whether a user is logged in or logged out. It does this by checking whether there's a user in the database with a given session id. If there is, this means the user is logged in and @current_user will store that user; otherwise the user is logged out and @current_user will be nil.
The line helper_method :current_user makes current_user method available in the views. By default, all methods defined in Application Controller are already available in the controllers.
The require_user method uses the current_user method to redirect logged out users to the login page.
Here's more on the ||= syntax. Here's more on the unless keyword.
Instructions
1.
Let's use require_user in the Albums controller in order prevent logged out users from accessing these pages. In the Albums controller, add this as the first line inside the class:

before_action :require_user, only: [:index, :show]
The before_action command calls the require_user method before running the index or show actions.
2.
Let's use current_user in application layout to update the nav items depending on whether a user is logged in or out. In app/views/layouts/application.html.erb, within <div class="nav pull-right"> on line 21 add:

<% if current_user %>
  <ul>
    <li><%= current_user.email %></li>
    <li><%= link_to "Log out", logout_path, method: "delete" %></li>
  </ul>
<% else %>
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to "Login", 'login' %></a></li>
    <li><%= link_to "Signup", 'signup' %></a></li>
  </ul>
<% end %>
3.
Log out of the app, and then visit http://localhost:8000/albums in the browser. You should be be redirected to the login page.
4.
Log in to the app with your email and password, and then visit http://localhost:8000/albums. You should now be able to access it.

Generalizations
Congratulations! You built an authentication system from scratch. What can we generalize so far?

An authentication system is made up of sign up, log in, log out functionality.
The password_digest column and has_secure_password method are provided by bcrypt to store passwords securely.
A session begins when a users logs in, and ends when a user logs out.
The current_user method allow us to access the current user; require_user redirects to the root of the app if there is no such user.
Before actions act as filters. They call methods before executing controller actions.
