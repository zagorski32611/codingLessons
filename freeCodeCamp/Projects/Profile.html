  Lido Anthony "Lee" Iacocca (/ˌaɪ.əˈkoʊkə/ EYE-ə-KOH-kə; born October 15, 1924)
  is an American automobile executive best known for spearheading the development
  of Ford Mustang and Pinto cars, while at the Ford Motor Company in the 1960s,
  and then later for reviving the Chrysler Corporation as its
  CEO during the 1980s.
  He served as President and CEO of Chrysler from 1978 and additionally as
  chairman from 1979, until his retirement at the end of 1992.

After receiving a loan guarantee in the amount of $1 billion dollars for
the Chrysler Corporation in 1982, he went on to lead the development of
the K Plaform, a fron wheel drive solid beam rear axle desing with many
interchangable parts that was used throughout Chrysler's lineup of
cars, convertables, couples and minivans.
